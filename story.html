	<p>JEFFERSON CITY â€” State Rep. Hannah Kelly wants to ensure that faith-based student organizations at universities and colleges are protected from discrimination.</p>

<p>Kelly, R-Mountain Grove, has proposed a bill that sets protective guidelines for those organizations. Currently, the U.S. Constitution and case law protect students' religious freedom in schools, but Kelly says she hopes to eliminate "gray areas" in the law.</p>

<p>The language of the bill, which was debated Tuesday evening in a House committee, states higher learning institutions have to recognize religious organizations and provide them with the same benefits that are available to other organizations.</p>

<p>Part of the language in the bill states that institutions have to respect "sincerely held religious beliefs" of the students. No one in committee mentioned any current events that were discriminatory against religious student groups.</p>

<p>Some lawmakers at Tuesday's hearing said that respecting all religious beliefs could be discriminatory.</p>

<p>State Rep. Jon Carpenter, D-Gladstone, said Bob Jones University, a Christian fundamentalist university in South Carolina, banned interracial dating until 2000. He asked if the institutions would be forced to respect and fund religious student groups that held discriminatory views and required participants to follow them.</p>

<p>"I am concerned of a blanket statement that any religious belief, no matter how extreme or discriminatory, must be permitted on campus even if that means some pretty radical views," Carpenter said. "So you know, I think we can find a balance to protect religious freedom without saying that any and every religious belief is going to be protected without any safeguards for the university."</p>

<p>Kelly said the point and purpose of the bill was to set guidelines for the expression of religion on college campuses, not to promote discrimination.</p>

<p>Chuck Basye, R-Rocheport, said he thinks there are current university policies in place that would prevent groups from discriminating.</p>

<p>"I could see where there could be some issues given what's going on around the world and everything, but I'm supportive of the intent of the bill."</p>

<p>Several religious organizations came to the committee to testify in support of the bill.</p>

<p>The committee also discussed a second bill proposed by Kelly that would allow elementary and secondary schools to "educate students about the history of traditional winter and spring celebrations." The bill states that such "traditional" greetings as "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Hanukkah" would be allowed.</p>

<p>Kelly said the point of the legislation is to eliminate any gray areas in what school districts may do.</p>

<p>After the hearing, Basye said he has seen examples of why such legislation would be helpful.</p>

<p>"My wife works at a public school in Columbia, and several years ago they had a big issue with a Christmas tree, and I don't quite understand the issue," he said. "You know, it wasn't being forced on anybody, it just sat in the lobby. So they choose to not call it a Christmas tree."</p>
<p>No vote was taken on the bills Tuesday.</p>
